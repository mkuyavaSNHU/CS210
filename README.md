# CS210 - Corner Grocer

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:

    Corner Grocer is a simple program that analyzes the text records that are generate throughout the day by a small grocer, that tracks items purchased in chronological order. Based     on user menu choice program will:
        ○ Produce a list of all items purchased on a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased
        ○ Produce a number to represent how many time a specific item was purchased on a given day or
        ○ Produces a text-based histogram listing all items purchased on a given day , along with a representation of the number of time each item was purchased. 
        ○ Exits the program

    The program is built with Python and C++. The Python code reads information from a text file, counts the frequency of each word representing an item and creates a histogram. The     C++ code displays UI/menu and accepts user input to interact with the menu. 

What did you do particularly well?
    
    Code is well written and documented. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    
    The UI/Menu could be modified to give the program a more modern feel. I used background color to add some life to the UI, however the limited color options in C++ makes the UI       feel dated. Additionally it may have been beneficial to user try/catch for input validation vs using if/else if statements. 


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

	The most challenging portion of the program for me was working with Python code. I have not yet taken any courses to learn Python so I had to spend some extra time learning and       researching the Python language. Some great resources that I came to rely on during this course are Stackoverflow, cplusplus.com, python.org and learnxinyminutes.com.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

	• The ability to research and learn an unfamiliar language. 
	• Learning how to integrate multiple languages
	• Trouble shooting issues/researching issues online/debugging
	
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
	
	To help make the program maintainable, readable and adaptable I made sure to include comments that provide explanation of what each function does and why specific pieces of code     were included. Additionally I tried to ensure that proper formatting and spacing was included to help keep the code readable and easy to follow.
